# 📊 Numerical Methods in Python

 A growing collection of classic **numerical algorithms** implemented in Python, focused on clarity, modularity, and educational value. Each method is organized independently to serve as a reference, learning tool, or base for academic or applied projects.

> 📘 Root finding, interpolation, integration, linear systems, and more — implemented one method at a time.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside
This repository aims to include well-documented, clean implementations of key numerical methods, such as:

- ✅ Root-finding algorithms
- ✅ Interpolation techniques
- ✅ Numerical integration rules
- ✅ Solvers for systems of linear equations
- ✅ Numerical differentiation

Each algorithm will be organized in its own module and accompanied by:

- Step-by-step iteration output (tabulated)
- Optional visualizations (`matplotlib`)
- Practical usage examples

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And execute using:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
